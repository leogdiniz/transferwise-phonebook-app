# Phonebook app for my hiring test at Transferwise

### How it works
This API uses SpringBoot for handling the requests, binding objects, convert to JSON and dependency injection.
For the front end I used twitter boostrap and jquery

### Installing and running
Download or clone this repository and run the following commands:

```sh
$ mvn clean install
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```

Then access http://localhost:8080
